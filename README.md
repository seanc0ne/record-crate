## About
Record Crate is a MERN stack application that acts as a repository for the all the information the user would want about the records they love. Itâ€™s as though the user had a milk crate full of preselected records right in front of them - They can gain just as much information from their tracks in Record Crate as they could if they were holding physical copies of their records in their own hands. 

## Dependencies
